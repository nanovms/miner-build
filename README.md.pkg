Helium Miner validator - git tag <MINER_RELEASE>
---------------------------------------------

This starts an instance of the Helium Miner test_validator, built from sources
derived from https://github.com/helium/miner.git (tag <MINER_RELEASE>).

To enable the validator to join the p2p network, you will need to configure
your firewall to make TCP ports 2154 and 8080 accessible from the outside
world.
